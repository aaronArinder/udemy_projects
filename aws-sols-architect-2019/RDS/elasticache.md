#### Overview
ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing the retrieval of information from fast, managed, in-memory caches rather than on slower disk-based databases. ElastiCache supports two open-source, in-memory caching engines: memcachedd and redis.
