#### Overview
The subdirectories here have examples of GraphQL in different contexts. Currently there are two, a simple example and an slightly more complex example using the simple example as its base. They both use Node and Express, and the simple example contains notes on GraphQL and a simple implementation of it. The `external-api` example mocks an asynchronous call to an external API (using `json-server`), showing how `RootQuery` resolves work with asynchronous requests. Both examples use the GraphiQL IDE, which is, as the kids say, `bomb-ass`. It lets you visualize queries and results, and self-documents the schema used by GraphQL. Super, super cool.

#### To run
Each example has instructions for running the example.
